How to start coding with SuperViz? After installing this package, youâ€™ll need to [create an account](https://dashboard.superviz.com/) to retrieve a SuperViz Token and start coding.

## Quickstart

### 1. Installation

Install SuperViz SDK in your React app with the npm package:

```bash
npm install --save @superviz/react-sdk
```

Or, with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @superviz/react-sdk
```

### 2. Import the SDK

Once installed, import the SDK to your code:

```jsx
import { SuperVizRoomProvider } from "@superviz/react-sdk";
```

### 3. Initialize the SDK

After importing the SDK, you can initialize our provider by passing your `DEVELOPER_KEY` and important information about the participant. You can see details for the options object on the [React Initialization page](https://docs.superviz.com/react-sdk/initialization).

The SuperVizRoomProvider is your primary gateway to access all SDK features, offering the essential methods to add its components.

```jsx
<SuperVizRoomProvider
		developerKey="DEVELOPER_KEY"
		group={{
			id: "<group-id>",
			name: "<group-name>",
		}}
		participant={{
			id: "<user-id>",
			name: "<user-name>",
		}}
		roomId="<room-id>">
	<h1>This is a room</h1>
</SuperVizRoomProvider>
```
